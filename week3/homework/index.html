						<h2>Where it all started off</h2>
							<p> I am the youngest of four kids, two boys and two girls. The oldest is Nicolas, then Jonathan, then Alicia and then theres me. My mom is from Camden South Carolina and my dad is from Barcelona, Spain. We have moved around a lot due to my dads job, but ended up in Atlanta for middle and high school. I have been fortunate enough to have been expoused to many countries and cultures. Having visited over 20 countries, and been to 5/7 continents. I am very athletic and love to play all kinds of sports, and I have always been artistic, but just started tapping into the field as soon as I graduated college.</p>

						<h2>Ala Madrid</h2>
							<p>It all started in Madrid Spain, where we lived there till I was little over 9 years old. A lot of my dads family is still there and i still have deep roots in Spain, visiting every year at least once. My family has a house in the north of Spain, in Comillas Santander, where we vacation in the summers and sometimes for Easter week.  </p>

						<h2>Moving to South America</h2>
							<p>Due to my dads job for the Coca cola company, we moved to Santiago Chile. Due to not knowing how to read or write in english (and being severely dyslexic) , I had to repeat a grade at my new school Nido de Aguilas. But besides that Chile was an amazing experience for my family, allowing us to travel to bordering countries and seeing some amazing scenes.</p>

						<h2>Georgia Peach and CocaCola</h2>
							<p>After about three and a half years we moved to Atlanta Georgia, where I entered into Atlanta International School. Here is where I received the International Baccalaureate degree (IB) and realized how much I loved art. </p>

						<h2>College</h2>
							<p>Not pursuing the art field, I decided to go to Elon University in North Carolina, but after a year I realized that this school was not for me so I transferred to Eckerd College in St Petersburg FL. Here I received a double major for International Business and Management, while being a college athlete for the Volleyball team. My sophomore year we made it to the sweet 16 for the NCAA tournament and were ranked 22 in the country, and we also upset the number 1 ranked team University of Tampa. Eckerd College was defiantly the school for me, here I made great friends, had a great education, played on a great team and met my boyfriend.</p>

							<P>I was able to take trips with my College, traveling around the world and experiencing different cultures. Winter Term is one month period in the month of January in which students can go abroad. It also allowed me as a college athlete to still have the opportunity to go abroad but not for the full semester. Above is a link  for the program, aswell as I am still in the website for the picture above with me in a Vietnamese hat with two other girls in my class.</P
